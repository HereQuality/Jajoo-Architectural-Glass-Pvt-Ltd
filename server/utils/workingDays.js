 * always counts forward from the entry moment itself. The working week
 * excludes whatever day(s) are configured as "weekly off"
 * (server/models/CompanySettings.js — Tuesday by default, editable from
 * Holiday Master). Company holidays (server/models/CompanyHoliday.js)
 * don't count either, for exactly the same reason: buildHolidaySet/
 * isHoliday below just make a holiday another day isWorkingDay() says no
 * to, so the 2-working-day window naturally extends one more calendar day
 * past it — no separate "bypass" branch needed.
