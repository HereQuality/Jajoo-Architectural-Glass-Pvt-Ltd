/**
 * middlewares/editWindow.middleware.js
 *
 * Enforces the "2 working days" edit window on Production Entries
 * (see server/utils/workingDays.js for the working-day math — the
 * configured weekly-off day(s) don't count, and Company Holidays don't
 * count either). Anchored to `createdAt` — when the entry was actually
 * SAVED — not its `date` field (the production date it's for), so a
 * backdated entry isn't already outside its edit window the moment it's
 * created; the window always runs 2 working days forward from the entry
 * moment itself, whatever date it was written for. Applied to PUT/DELETE
 * routes for :entryId, after requireMenuPermission has already confirmed
 * the user has write access to the page at all. SuperAdmin bypasses this,
 * same convention as requireMenuPermission's own SuperAdmin bypass.
