 * OEE Calculation Service — Glass Grinding
 *
 * ── History ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 2026-08-31: switched Working Schedule/Total Stoppage/Available Working/
 * Effective Run Time/Availability/Performance/Quality/OEE%/Overtime/Start
 * Delay/Early Closed to BATCH-level (identical across every entry saved
 * together from one "Add Entry" submission), to stop the Efficiency Report/
 * Dashboard OEE trend from double- or triple-counting a shift's schedule
 * time when it was split across multiple rows.
 *
 * 2026-09-02: reverted by explicit user decision — every row in a batch
 * showing identical numbers looked wrong for genuinely different entered
 * data (different M/C times, different quantities per row), so `calculated`
 * stored on each entry became PER-ROW, using ONLY that row's own M/C
 * Start/Off, quantities, and stoppage minutes. At that point Working
 * Schedule Time still extended every row out to the full shift envelope
 * (see the superseded formula below), so the double-counting problem was
 * handled separately at report time via aggregateBatchLevelTotals.
 *
 * 2026-09-03: Working Schedule Time redefined again, per the user's own
 * worked examples, to be POSITION-AWARE within a batch instead of every row
 * independently re-covering the whole shift:
 *   - Only the chronologically FIRST row in a batch can extend its own
 *     start backward past Shift On (if it began early) — or forward to
 *     Shift On (if it began late, pulling the pre-start gap into itself).
 *   - Only the chronologically LAST row can extend its own end forward past
 *     Shift Off (if it finished late) — or backward to Shift Off (if it
 *     finished early, pulling the post-end gap into itself).
 *   - Every row in between uses ONLY its own actual M/C Start/Off — no
 *     shift envelope at all.
 * A standalone entry (no batchId) is simultaneously first AND last, which
 * reduces to exactly the pre-2026-09-03 single-row formula — no behavior
 * change for solo entries. Overtime/Start Delay/Early Closed are similarly
 * gated: only the first row can show Start Delay/early-start Overtime, only
 * the last can show Early Closed/late-finish Overtime — a middle row always
 * shows zero for all three, since it isn't touching either shift boundary.
 *
 * This makes each row's Working Schedule Time a genuinely non-overlapping
 * slice of the shift timeline (any real gap BETWEEN two rows' own M/C times
 * — e.g. an unlogged break — belongs to neither row and simply isn't
 * "scheduled" time for anyone), so summing every row's own value across a
 * batch now gives the mathematically correct combined total directly — see
 * computeBatchCalculations below, which no longer needs a separate overall-
 * envelope calculation to avoid double-counting.
 *
 * Because a row's own Working Schedule Time (and Overtime/Start Delay/
 * Early Closed) now depend on whether it's first/last among its siblings —
 * not just its own fields — saving, editing, or deleting one row in a batch
 * DOES need to recompute its siblings again (see computeBatchRowCalculations
 * below and its callers in productionEntry.controller.js). This reinstates
 * the cross-row recompute that the 2026-09-02 per-row-only design had
 * removed as a simplification; that simplification no longer holds once
 * position within the batch matters.
 *
 * ── Per-row formulas (computeRowCalculations) ───────────────────────────
 *
 *   Working Schedule Time   = duration from [this row's own effective start]
 *                             to [this row's own effective end], where:
 *                               effective start = (isFirst) ? earlier of
 *                                 (Shift On, this row's M/C Start) : this
 *                                 row's own M/C Start
 *                               effective end = (isLast) ? later of
 *                                 (Shift Off, this row's M/C Off) : this
 *                                 row's own M/C Off
 *   Total Stoppage          = this row's own Downtime & Stoppage Reason
 *                             minutes, INCLUDING Planned Downtime (see the
 *                             2026-09-05 history note above).
 *   Available Working Time  = Working Schedule Time − Total Stoppage (NA
 *                             when Total Stoppage ≥ Working Schedule Time)
 *   Effective M/C Run Time  = this row's own actual on-time span (M/C Off
 *                             − M/C Start) — the real clock time the
 *                             machine ran for this row. Unaffected by the
 *                             first/last position logic above.
 *   Unreported Time         = Available Working Time − Effective M/C Run
 *                             Time (NA if AWT is NA), floored at 0. Only
 *                             captures a pause BETWEEN TWO PERIODS OF THE
 *                             SAME ROW (see the 2026-09-06 note) — a gap
 *                             between two different rows belongs to
 *                             neither (see the 2026-09-07 revert note).
 *   Planned Production Time = Working Schedule Time − Planned Downtime −
 *                             Lunch Break (floored at 0)
 *   Availability Ratio      = Available Working Time ÷ Planned Production
 *                             Time (NA if Planned Production Time is 0) —
 *                             standard OEE, see the 2026-09-11 note below.
 *   Performance Ratio       = (this row's own Production Qty × Standard
 *                             Time) ÷ this row's own Effective M/C Run Time
 *                             (NA if AWT is NA) — the classic OEE
 *                             speed-loss ratio for this row alone.
 *   Quality Ratio           = this row's own OK Qty ÷ Production Qty.
 *   OEE %                   = Availability × Performance × Quality × 100
 *                             (NA if AWT is NA)
 *   Ideal Production (Qty)  = this row's own (M/C Off − M/C Start) ÷ its
 *                             own Standard Time per Glass — unaffected by
 *                             the first/last logic, already purely per-row.
 *   Overtime / Start Delay / Early Closed — derived from the shared Shift
 *   On/Off vs. THIS ROW's own M/C On/Off Time, gated by position:
 *     Start Delay    = (isFirst) ? max(0, M/C Start − Shift On) : 0
 *     early-start part of Overtime = (isFirst) ? max(0, Shift On − M/C Start) : 0
 *     Early Closed   = (isLast) ? max(0, Shift Off − M/C Off) : 0
 *     late-finish part of Overtime = (isLast) ? max(0, M/C Off − Shift Off) : 0
 *     Overtime       = early-start part + late-finish part
 *
 * NOTE on capping: Effective M/C Run Time is just the row's raw M/C Off −
 * M/C Start clock span — it doesn't itself subtract stoppage minutes
 * reported inside that same span. So if M/C Start/Off is entered as the
 * whole shift while stoppage is ALSO logged within it, Effective Run Time
 * (not stoppage-adjusted) can come out bigger than Available Working Time
 * (which IS stoppage-adjusted), which would otherwise give a
 * negative Unreported Time — clamped at 0 to prevent that (added
 * 2026-09-02). This used to also apply to Availability, until 2026-09-11.
 *
 * `calculated` is computed server-side at save time and stored, so
 * historical rows never change unless explicitly recomputed (see
 * seed/recomputeCalculated.js).
 *
 * 2026-09-05: Total Stoppage now INCLUDES Planned Downtime (previously
 * excluded — Planned Downtime used to only ever show up as its own entered
 * field, never subtracted from anything). This only changes Total Stoppage/
 * Available Working Time/Availability Ratio/Unreported Time/OEE% — Ideal
 * Production and Performance Ratio deliberately stay based on this row's
 * own raw Effective M/C Run Time (unchanged), not Available Working Time,
 * since Performance is meant to measure this row's own actual run against
 * its own actual output, not against the whole shift's schedule.
 *
 * 2026-09-06: A single row can now have more than one M/C ON/OFF period
 * (mcStartTime/mcOffTime plus any `additionalPeriods`), still sharing one
 * production/downtime record. Effective M/C Run Time is the SUM of every
 * period's own duration for that row (never the raw span from the first
 * period's start to the last period's end), so a pause between two periods
 * of the SAME row is excluded from run time — and automatically flows into
 * that row's own Unreported Time via Available Working Time minus
 * Effective Run Time. Everywhere "this row's own start/end" previously
 * meant row.mcStartTime/row.mcOffTime directly (Working Schedule Time
 * bounds, Start Delay/Early Closed/Overtime, Ideal Production), it now
 * means the EARLIEST period's start / LATEST period's end (see rowPeriods/
 * rowOwnSpan below) — a no-op when there are no additional periods.
 *
 * 2026-09-07: REVERTED the 2026-09-05 gap-attribution change (a non-last
 * row's Working Schedule Time reaching forward to the NEXT row's own
 * start) — by explicit user decision, after seeing it inflate a row's own
 * Working Schedule Time past its own actual span (e.g. a row spanning
 * 09:30–11:15 showing 120 min of WST instead of its own 105-minute span,
 * because the next row didn't start until 11:30). A non-last row's
 * Working Schedule Time now stops at its OWN last period's end again,
 * matching the 2026-09-03 design: any gap between two rows' own M/C times
 * belongs to NEITHER row and simply isn't "scheduled" time for anyone — a
 * batch's total Working Schedule Time can legitimately be less than the
 * full shift when there are such gaps. This does NOT affect the 2026-09-06
 * multi-period behavior: a pause between two periods of the SAME row still
 * flows into that row's own Unreported Time, since that only depends on
 * this row's own span vs. its own summed run time, never the next row.
 *
 * 2026-09-11: Availability Ratio switched to the standard OEE definition —
 * Available Working Time ÷ Planned Production Time (Working Schedule Time
 * minus the PLANNED stops only: Planned Downtime + Lunch Break). The old
 * Effective M/C Run Time ÷ Available Working Time came out ≥100% for almost
 * every entry (Effective Run Time is the raw M/C span and doesn't subtract
 * stoppage logged inside it, while AWT does), so the 100% cap hid it and
 * breakdowns/changeovers/etc. never lowered Availability — 48 of 62 live
 * entries showed exactly 100%. Now every unplanned stoppage minute lowers
 * Availability, while planned stops don't count against the machine.

// overlapping slice of the shift timeline (2026-09-03), the combined batch
// total for every additive field is simply the SUM of each row's own

// needed anymore, and none would even be correct: an overall min-start-to-
// max-end envelope would silently re-include any real gap BETWEEN two rows
// (e.g. an unlogged break) as if it were scheduled time, which the per-row
